80057710 Load debug font

this routine loads a word from 80150298, which is 801404D8
adds 8 to that and stores it back again
it then stores at this address:
06000000 0D008108 call list
06000000 0D008080 call list
B9000002 00000001 set other mode L
it looks like it adds 8 three separate times, lolinefficiency
I assume the "other mode" being set here is an orthographic mode or something,
and those dlists load the font texture.
there might be other interesting debug stuff in segment 13 then
