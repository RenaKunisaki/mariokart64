AI path notes:
-Path 1's point IDs are always all zero.
-The last path's point IDs increment.
-If 3 paths exist, the second follows a different route (Koopa Beach: around the left of Turtle Rock, over the hidden sandbar) and is white. Or, it defines some other path (Kalimari Desert: the train; DK Jungle: the boat) and has all point IDs = 0.
-Battle courses have only one path, which does things like running into walls, but doesn't appear random. It increments.
 -Possibly these points don't make up a path? Maybe they define item box positions?

Yoshi Valley is an exception, probably because it has multiple possible routes:
-Path 1 is blue
-Path 2 is white and follows a different route
-Path 3 increments

Luigi Raceway (#8)... uh, yeah. O_o it may be reading the paths from somewhere else.

163288 : 4 byte signed integer. Some kind of progress counter, like roughly how many meters you are into the race. Starts off at -2 (since you're behind the finish line)... gets to 0 when you cross the finish line at the start of the race... increases as you go around the lap. LR lap 1 ends around 630, MR at 500, CM at 605. It continues to increase as you go around the other laps. It goes into negative values if you turn around at the start of the race and drive backwards.
